# SimpleRecorder
A simple screen recording tool because everything else was too complicated for me.  

Click the record button to record your mouse and keyboard movements. Press whatever key your inputted in the End Recording Key text box to end the recording. Clicking the record button during the recording also ends it. Enter the number of times you want to run the recording under the Number of Executions text box. Input the speed at which you want the recording to run in the Speed text box. Speeds of less than 1 run slower than the original recording, and speeds of greater than 1 run faster. A speed of 0 causes the computer to replay the actions as fast as possible.

Click run to run the recordings at the number of times and speed specified.  

The default key to terminate the recording is F8, the default speed is 1, and the default number of times to run is 1.

Click Exit to exit the program, and click Clear Recording to reset the recording to a blank slate.
