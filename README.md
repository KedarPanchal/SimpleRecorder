# SimpleRecorder
A simple screen recording tool because everything else was too complicated for me.  

Click the record button to record your mouse and keyboard movements. Press whatever key your inputted in the End Recording Key text box to end the recording. Enter the number of times you want to run the recording under the Number of Executions text box. Click run to run the recordings that number of times.  

Click Exit to exit the program, and click Clear Recording to reset the recording to a blank slate.
